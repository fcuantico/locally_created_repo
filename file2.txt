This files describes the exercises
done to learn github commands and protocols:

1. The first exercise was to creat a repository
from github and locally. In this step the most important 
thing is the URL address to github to be able to host
the files.

2. Then a file was created locally and the push command
was introduced to be able to "upoload" files locally to github.
Here the key was the command "git push"

3. Then a change was done to previous created file, and was saved
in the local repo, to then push it to github.

4. The next exercise is about changing file names and deleting files.
To that end we will work with a temporary file. The idea here is that all
changes that are done must be commited and then pushed to github.
